Python Image Encryption and Decryption Tool Using Pixel Manipulation

This project is a Python application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by manipulating their pixels. The program uses simple pixel-wise operations to encode and decode images. This provides a basic but effective method of image encryption.

The tool features a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter. This allows users to easily load images, apply encryption or decryption, and save the processed images. The graphical interface makes it accessible even for users with limited programming experience.

Key features include.
• Easy to use Tkinter based GUI for loading, saving, and processing images.
• Encrypt and decrypt images by altering pixel values in a reversible way.
• Support for common image formats such as PNG and JPEG.
• Visual feedback through the interface showing the original and processed images.

This application is ideal for educational purposes. It demonstrates how pixel manipulation can be used for simple image encryption. It also serves as a foundation for exploring more advanced image security techniques.

To use the program, launch the GUI, select an image file, choose to encrypt or decrypt, and save the output. The program will handle the pixel manipulation automatically and display results within the interface.
